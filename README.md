# Advanced-Predictive-Analytics-for-job-change-intentions
A Big Data and Data Science company uses predictive models to identify candidates likely to stay post-training. By analyzing demographic and experience data, the company optimizes hiring, improves training quality, and plans courses effectively, enhancing talent retention and reducing costs.

Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises demographic details, education, and professional experience from candidates who signed up for the company’s training programs. Our primary goal was to predict the probability of a candidate looking for new job opportunities post-training, aiding the company in talent management and course offering adjustments.

Technologies Used

Python and Data Science Libraries:

Python: The cornerstone of our data analysis, favoured for its extensive libraries and community support.

Pandas: For data manipulation and ingestion, transforming raw data into a structured format.

NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations on data arrays.

Seaborn and Matplotlib: These libraries provided sophisticated plotting capabilities to visualize data distributions and insights effectively.

Scikit-learn: This machine learning library was crucial for modelling and evaluating various predictive algorithms.

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE): Specifically used to handle the imbalanced nature of our dataset, enhancing model performance by oversampling the minority class.

Machine Learning Models:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Though not the top performer, it helped establish a baseline for model comparison.

Logistic Regression: Used for its interpretability and effectiveness in binary classification problems.

Random Forest Classifier: The standout model providing the highest precision and recall, capable of handling large data sets with a complex mix of categorical and numerical features.

Model Evaluation Tools:

Cross-Validation (Repeated Stratified K-Fold): Ensured that model evaluations were robust and not biased to a specific subset of the data.

GridSearchCV: For exhaustive searching over specified parameter values of models, ensuring optimal configurations.

Precision and Recall Scores: Focused metrics given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, ensuring that both the majority and minority classes were predicted with accuracy.

Model Development and Evaluation

I experimented with several models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests. The performance of these models was rigorously evaluated using Repeated Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to ensure the reliability of our predictions. Here’s how the models stacked up:
Random Forest: Emerged as the most effective model, providing an optimal balance of precision and recall. This model was particularly adept at handling the imbalanced dataset due to its ensemble method, aggregating predictions across multiple decision trees to reduce variance and bias.

Conclusion:
In my data-driven initiative, I’ve tapped into the predictive power of machine learning to discern the probability of candidates committing to the company after training. By deploying a Random Forest model, optimized with SMOTE to counteract dataset imbalances, I’ve precisely gauged this likelihood. My analytical deep dive has spotlighted crucial influencers such as the city development index and relevant experience that sway a candidate’s decision to stay or venture elsewhere. These revelations have been pivotal in sharpening my recruitment strategy and tailoring my training offerings, thus elevating my HR operations to be not only more effective but also more strategic. With continual refinements to my predictive models and a steadfast dedication to a data-first approach, I steer my HR endeavors towards a future marked by informed, proactive, and agile decision-making in step with the dynamic business landscape.
